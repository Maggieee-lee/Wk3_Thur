## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
accidents <- readRDS(here("data", "accidents.rds"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
Weekday <- filter(accidents, day_of_week != "Saturday" & day_of_week != "Sunday")
Weekend <- filter(accidents, day_of_week == "Saturday" | day_of_week == "Sunday")
plot1 <- Weekday %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, color = severity, fill = severity)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs (x = "Time of day", y = "Density")+
  ggtitle("Number of accidents throughtout the day") 
  
plot2 <- Weekend %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, color = severity, fill = severity)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs (x = "Time of day", y = "Density")+
  ggtitle("Number of accidents throughtout the day")

plot1/plot2
Weekday <- filter(accidents, day_of_week != "Saturday" & day_of_week != "Sunday")
mutate(filter(accidents, day_of_week != "Saturday" & day_of_week != "Sunday") = "Weekday")

accidents2 <- accidents %>% 
  mutate(day_week = ifelse(wday(date) %in% c(1,7), "Weekend", "Weekday" ))

accidents2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, fill = severity)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs (x = "Time of day", y = "Density")+
  ggtitle("Number of accidents throughtout the day") +
  facet_wrap(~day_week, dir = "v")
  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
